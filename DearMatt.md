Hey Matt,

Thanks for the help this semester and teaching me HTML/CSS/Javascript and all those other goodies. I achieved my goal of designing a simple
website to host my astrophotography / photography images. I figure this website will always be a work in progress with me trying to add new
content as I continue to learn more about designing the interweb. I had planned on adding more content to my site but ran out of time, however
I will be adding more over the next few days so you might catch some of it. My plan is to add individual pages for each astrophoto I have (M31, M42, & Milkyway)
to have a detailed page with my progress over the last year. I would use some nifty transitions to make the images look coolER. I forget what
else we had to add in here, but again thanks for the help this semester. I'm keeping an eye out for any open positions in the continuation of this
course, if not no big deal I'll try again next semester!
